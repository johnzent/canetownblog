(1, 'Biking Destinations in and around Manila', 'Compared to many other cities and countries, Metro Manila is not a bike-friendly destination. The city itself, with the urban sprawl, horrible traffic, and lack of safe and secure bicycle lanes, makes it pretty scary to explore on two wheels. Sure, you can find areas for urban biking in the city but chances are, these spots are difficult to get to and you’ll be exposed to the polluted city most of the time.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor those who want to bike safely somewhere with a refreshing view of nature, there are only a handful of places in and near the metro that have scenic trails and parks ideal for biking. These are just a few of the best that I can personally recommend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE: While biking for exercise is one of the few allowable activities during the GCQ period, please take note that as of July 2020, not all destinations have reopened to bikers because of COVID-related restrictions. Bike rentals and tours are suspended while some restaurants mentioned are still closed or open for pickup/takeout only and not dine-in.\r\n\r\n', '1613421782bicycle.jpg', '2021-02-16', 6),

The State University is known for its 2.2 kilometer long tree-lined Academic Oval with a designated bikers’ and runners’ lane, one of the best places to do rounds in the city on any type of bike.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Sundays, the entire area is closed off to motorized vehicles so it’s a top destination for runners, bikers, longboard skaters and families who just want to enjoy the shade of the trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nAside from circling the oval, you can also find a lot of wide grassy areas and hidden trails around the campus including behind The Science Complex, Heartbreak Hill, University Avenue Pump Track and Lagoon area.\r\n\r\n\r\nPoints of interest in UP include the Oblation statue, UP Vargas Museum, public art installations, street food and street art. Seasonal sights include the fire trees (summer), sunflowers planted along the University Avenue during graduation season and the Lantern Parade (Christmas). Sadly, the UP Bike Trails, the two short XC tracks near the College of Human Kinetics (CHK) which served as the venue of various races and bike events, have become overgrown and are no longer bikeable.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIPS & USEFUL INFO:\r\n\r\nEntrance fee: None\r\nBikes for rent: None.

The urban park features several smaller gardens within its grounds including a flower garden, a tropical garden, and a demo urban farm.\r\n\r\n\r\nAside from being a refreshing place to jog, walk and go biking and have picnics, QMC is also a great place to buy plants including potted herbs, ornamental plants, succulents, and other home gardening essentials.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIPS & USEFUL INFO:\r\n\r\nEntrance fee: None\r\nBikes for rent: Bikes are available for rent at the QMC bicycle station.

The pump track is made of asphalt, giving tires more traction.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe outdoor trail is very short, but well-designed and offers a few twists, ramps and jumps for a quick trail biking fix. Bikers can bring their own mountain bikes suitable for the trail and pump track, but they also have bikes for rent. There’s a shower room and lounge for bikers and lots of bike parking spaces near the restaurants.
